# 🚗 Car Fleet Management System

The **Car Fleet Management System** is a full-stack solution designed to monitor and manage a fleet of vehicles in real-time. It includes:

- 📱 A mobile app (Android) to track car locations
- 🕸️ A web platform (Spring Boot) for admin control
- 🔗 An integrated REST API for communication
- 📊 Documentation and database schema for deployment and maintenance

---

## 📱 Android Application

The **Android app** is used by drivers and installed in each vehicle. It periodically sends the GPS coordinates of the car to the backend system using HTTP requests or background services.

### Features

- 📍 Real-time location tracking via GPS
- 🔐 Secure login for drivers
- 📡 Sends location to server via REST API
- 📷 Optionally capture vehicle images or documents
- 🔋 Optimized for background usage with minimal battery drain

### Tech Stack

- Language: Java or Kotlin
- IDE: Android Studio
- Permissions:
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
  ```

### Firebase or Local DB
Optional: Firebase used for auth/logging, or Room database for local data caching.

---

## 🕸️ Web Application (Admin Dashboard)

Built using **Spring Boot**, the web application allows fleet managers to monitor and manage the car fleet in real-time.

### Features

- 🗺️ View car positions on an interactive map
- 🚘 Register and manage vehicles
- 👤 Manage drivers and accounts
- 🧾 View movement history and logs
- 📊 Dashboard with key metrics (e.g., number of active cars)

### Tech Stack

- Spring Boot (REST + Web MVC)
- Thymeleaf or React for frontend (if applicable)
- MySQL / PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Hibernate / JPA for ORM
- Spring Security for authentication

---

## 🔗 API (Communication Layer)

The Android and web apps communicate using a RESTful API built in **Spring Boot**.

### Example Endpoints

- `POST /api/location` – Submit current location
- `GET /api/vehicles/{id}/location` – Get last known location
- `GET /api/vehicles` – List all vehicles
- `PUT /api/vehicles/{id}` – Update vehicle status/info

## 🧪 Running the Project

### Android App

1. Open `AndroidApp` in Android Studio
2. Add location permissions and run on a real device
3. Set the backend API base URL in the app settings

### Web Dashboard

1. Open `WebApp` in IntelliJ or Eclipse
2. Configure `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fleetdb
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Access it via: `http://localhost:8080`
